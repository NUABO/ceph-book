1、use pgtemp  only if up_primary's pglog is less than auth's;
2、separate pg's info out of OSDMAP,since osdmap only represents osd's
   state or number change!
   
3、scrubbing affects user's IO, we can consider continuing scrub after finished IO,
if more IOs, then consider scrub at other time or scrub other objects!
